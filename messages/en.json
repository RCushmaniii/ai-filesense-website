      "a3": "The Review folder (12 Review) contains files where the AI wasn't confident about the correct category. This is intentional—rather than guess wrong, AI FileSense lets you decide. You can manually move these files or re-run organization after adding more context.",
      "q4": "Can I exclude certain files from being organized?",
      "a4": "Yes! In Step 3 (Preview), you can uncheck specific files to exclude them, exclude entire folders/categories, or enable Test mode to preview without moving anything.",
      "q5": "Does AI FileSense work with languages other than English?",
      "a5": "Yes! AI FileSense is fully bilingual (English and Spanish/Mexico). The AI can also classify documents written in Spanish. Switch languages anytime using the language toggle in the header.",
      "q6": "What file types are supported?",
      "a6": "Phase 1 supports PDF documents (.pdf), Microsoft Word (.doc, .docx), PowerPoint presentations (.pptx), and text files (.txt, .md, .log, .csv). Coming soon: Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx), images, and more.",
      "q7": "Where do my organized files go?",
      "a7": "All files are moved to Documents/Organized Files/ with numbered subfolders (01 Work, 02 Money, etc.). The numbered prefixes ensure folders always appear in the same order regardless of your file explorer settings.",
      "q8": "Can I run AI FileSense again after organizing?",
      "a8": "Absolutely! Click the AI FileSense logo or use \"Organize Again\" on the Dashboard. The app automatically skips files already in the Organized Files folder, so it only processes new files.",
      "q9": "What if the AI categorizes a file incorrectly?",
      "a9": "You have multiple opportunities to correct this: In Step 3 (Preview), the AI asks clarifying questions about ambiguous files and you can exclude files from organization. After organization, move files manually or use Undo. The AI learns from the clarification questions you answer, improving accuracy for similar files.",
      "q10": "Is an internet connection required?",
      "a10": "Yes, for AI classification. The file scanning happens locally, but classifying files requires sending snippets to the Claude AI service. Without internet, you can't run a new scan, but you can still access previously organized files.",
      "q11": "Do I need to set up an API key or create an account?",
      "a11": "No. AI FileSense works out of the box with no configuration required. No API keys, no accounts, no sign-up. Just download and run."

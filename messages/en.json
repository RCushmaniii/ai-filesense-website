    },
    "questions": {
      "q1": "Is my data safe? Do my files get uploaded anywhere?",
      "a1": "Your files never leave your computer. AI FileSense only sends small text snippets (~500 characters) and anonymized filenames to the AI for classification. Full file contents are never transmitted. Your username is stripped from file paths for additional privacy.",
      "q2": "What happens if I don't like how files were organized?",
      "a2": "Every file move is logged with the original and new location. You can undo any single file move, undo an entire session, or roll back everything to the original state. Even if the app crashes mid-organization, you can fully recover.",
      "q3": "Why are some files put in the 'Review' folder?",
      "a3": "When the AI isn't confident about where a file belongs (below 70% confidence), it goes to the Review folder. This keeps your organization clean while letting you make the final call on ambiguous documents.",
      "q4": "Can I exclude certain files from being organized?",
      "a4": "Yes. During the preview phase, you can deselect any files you want to keep in place. You can also exclude entire folders or file types from scanning in the initial setup.",
      "q5": "Does AI FileSense work with languages other than English?",
      "a5": "Yes! AI FileSense is fully bilingual with complete English and Spanish (Mexico) support. The AI can read and correctly categorize documents written in either language.",
      "q6": "What file types are supported?",
      "a6": "AI FileSense extracts content from PDF files (first page), Word documents (.doc, .docx - full text), PowerPoint (.pptx - slide text), and text files (.txt, .md, .log, .csv - first 100 lines). Any file can be classified by filename alone.",
      "q7": "Where do my organized files go?",
      "a7": "Files are moved into 11 numbered folders (01 Work through 11 Review) within your chosen destination. The numbered prefixes keep folders in logical order in File Explorer.",
      "q8": "Can I run AI FileSense again after organizing?",
      "a8": "Absolutely. You can run AI FileSense as many times as you want. It's smart enough to recognize already-organized files and will focus on new or changed documents.",
      "q9": "What if the AI categorizes a file incorrectly?",
      "a9": "You always preview all changes before they happen. Simply change the suggested folder during preview. If you notice an error after organizing, use the Activity Log to move the file wherever you want.",
      "q10": "Is an internet connection required?",
      "a10": "An internet connection is needed for AI classification (communicating with Anthropic's API). However, scanning files, reviewing changes, and undoing moves all work completely offline."

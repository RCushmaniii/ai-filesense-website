## The Problem

Most indie software developers and small businesses ship a desktop app and then struggle with everything that comes after. They end up with a bare GitHub releases page, a single-page HTML site, or a WordPress blog they'll never update. The result:

- **No discoverability** — Google can't index what doesn't exist
- **No trust signals** — visitors land on a generic page and bounce
- **No bilingual reach** — an entire market written off because "we'll add Spanish later"
- **No support system** — users email a personal Gmail, questions go unanswered
- **No conversion path** — a download link exists but nothing explains *why* someone should click it

AI FileSense needed more than a landing page. It needed a complete product launch platform.

## The Solution

We built a **17-page marketing and support website** that handles everything between "I built an app" and "I have a business."

### Full Marketing Funnel

Seven sections covering every page a real software product needs: Home, Features, Pricing, Download, Support (FAQ + Getting Started + Contact), About, Blog, Changelog, Privacy, and Terms. Each page is designed to build trust and drive downloads.

### Bilingual From Day One (EN + ES-MX)

Every string lives in structured JSON translation files. Locale-based URL routing (`/en/features`, `/es/features`). The sitemap generates `hreflang` alternates for every page in both languages. Google indexes both versions and serves the right one to the right audience.

### SEO That Actually Works

- Dynamic metadata per page (title, description, Open Graph, Twitter cards)
- Auto-generated XML sitemap with priorities, change frequencies, and `hreflang` alternates
- Auto-generated `robots.txt`
- Canonical URLs with locale-aware alternates
- Semantic HTML throughout

### Working Contact & Lead Capture System

A production contact form with client-side validation (React Hook Form + Zod), server-side validation (Server Actions — no exposed API endpoints), honeypot spam protection, and transactional email delivery via Resend with professionally designed React Email templates.

### Complete Support Hub

- **Getting Started guide** — 5-step walkthrough with the full folder system explained
- **FAQ** — 11 questions covering data safety, undo, file types, bilingual support, internet requirements
- **Contact form** — validated, spam-protected, email-delivering

### Software Distribution

The download page includes system requirements (minimum vs. recommended), a 5-step quick-start guide, feature trust badges, and links to support resources. The installer is hosted on GitHub Releases — free, reliable, and versioned.

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture

- **Next.js 14 App Router** — Server Components by default, client-only where needed
- **TypeScript strict mode** — no implicit `any`, no shortcuts
- **Tailwind CSS** with CSS variables and a `cn()` utility for a consistent, themeable design system
- **Dark mode** — class-based with localStorage persistence and FOUC prevention
- **Component library** — Button (4 variants), Card, Badge, Container (4 sizes), Section (4 spacings), PageHero (multiple background variants)
- **Accessibility** — skip-to-content link, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, WCAG AA contrast

### Performance

Lighthouse scores from production deployment:

| Category | Score |

Core Web Vitals: FCP 0.3s, LCP 0.4s, TBT 0ms, CLS 0.

### Security

- Honeypot field on contact form for spam protection
- Zod schema validation on all form inputs (client + server)
- Server Actions for form processing (no exposed API routes)
- Environment variables for all sensitive configuration

## Results

| Metric | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Pages | 17 across 7 sections |
| Languages | 2 (English + Spanish MX) |
| Lighthouse Performance | 100/100 |
| First Contentful Paint | 0.3s |
| Translation strings | 500+ per language |
| Contact form | Validated, spam-protected, email-delivering |
| SEO | Auto-generated sitemap, OG cards, `hreflang` alternates |

## Why It Matters

This website is the difference between "I built an app" and "I have a business." It handles discoverability, trust, conversion, support, and distribution — the parts most solo developers and small teams skip. The parts that determine whether anyone actually downloads the product.
